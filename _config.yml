# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely need to edit after that.
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
title: my Website

description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  This site was built during a Codecademy class on deploying a website.
  The class used Jekyll to create a static site, so the focus wasn't on
  content or user experience.  Changes will come later as I get time to 
  learn more.  
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://chrisg.rocks" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
