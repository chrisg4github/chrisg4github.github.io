This site was created on07/13/2017 as a part of a Codecademy class on Deploy a Website.  It is a site created using
Jekyll, so it is a static site.  I have Jekyll and some other components on on my laptop now, but I have little time
to put into the site.  I did make a bio page for a class activity which replaced my static page from Deploy a Website.
Next Steps:
1) Learn more about Jekyll and how to make modest changes to the site
2) Look for a class on publishing a more robust site so I can practice other skills.
