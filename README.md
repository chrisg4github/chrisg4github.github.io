This site was created on07/13/2017 as a part of a Codecademy class on Deploy a Website.  It is a site created using
Jekyll, so it is a static site.  I don't have Jekyll or any other content on on my laptop yet so pushing out something
new isn't in the picture yet.  This is a learning experience!
Next Steps:
1) Install Jekyll on my laptop
2) Learn more about Jekyll and how to make modest changes to the site
3) Look for a class on publishing a more robust site so I can practice other skills.
