This site was created on 07/13/2017 as a part of a Codecademy class on Deploy a Website.  It is a site created using Jekyll (jekyll is written in ruby), and it is a blog aware site which means it is set up for any number of posts to be displayed on the site.  I've made very few changes to the main page, but I add a link to my bio page and another for a weather visualization project.
Next Steps:
1) Continue to learn about jekyll, jekyll serve --watch, jekyll serve --incremental, and working with GitHub.

2) Continue to add links to my projects, so my site becomes a portfolio of my work in data analytics.

3) Make the site a little less static and have a little more pizzazz.
