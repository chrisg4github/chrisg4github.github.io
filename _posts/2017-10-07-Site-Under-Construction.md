Still busy with class, so I'm not able to do much too improve this site.  However, maybe I can think in terms of "doing no harm".  Some of my class activities and homework may affect this site, or have already affected this site.  For example, now I have a Bio page off the main page that was a class activity, and the Bio page is pretty plain for these days.  And I have a link to a series of pages, a Data Visualization homework on the weather.  That group of pages still need work on the bootstrap design, so I'm in the beginning of redoing the basic bootstrap grid.  Those pages should look better after my redesign.  After class is over, I will devote some time to make the website a little easier on the eyes with some title changes, font and bolding, background color, and removing some of the clutter leftover  from the basic design.
