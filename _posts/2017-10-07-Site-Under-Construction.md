Still busy with class, so I'm not able to do much good with this site.  However, maybe I can think in terms of doing no harm.  Some of my class activities and homework will affect this site, and have already affected this site.  For example, now I have a bio page off the main page that was a class activity, and the page is pretty plain for these days.  I have another page, a Data Visualization homework of another previous homework on the weather.  That group of pages still need work, and I'm in the beginning of redoing to basic bootstrap grid design.  Those pages should look better after my redesign.  After class is over, I will devote some time to trying to play with JavaScript and libraries like Jquery and D3 to jazz up my site.
