Still busy with class, so I'm not able to do much good with this site.  However, maybe I can think in terms of doing no harm.  Some of my class activities and homework will affect this site, and have already affected this site.  For example, now I have a bio page off the main page that was a class activity, and that is pretty basic and plain for a page these days.  I have another page, a Data Visualization homework of another previous homework on the weather.  That group of pages still need work, and I'm in the beginning of redoing to basic bootstrap grid design.  Those pages should look better after my redesign but time will tell.  After class is over, I will devote some time to trying to play with javascript and libraries like jquery to jazz up my site. 

Jekyll Notes:
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
