Still busy with class, so I'm not able to do much with this site.  I installed Jekyll and associated applications in my local environment.  Now in class activities, we are making changes to GitHub, that impacted my site, and I'm trying to understand the impact and what version of jekyll I'm running, how to move changes out (push to GitHub), and how to put out new posts. 

Jekyll Notes:
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
