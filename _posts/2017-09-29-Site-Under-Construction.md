Still busy with class, so I'm not able to do much with this site.  However, some of my class activities are going to affect this site.  For example, now I have a Bio page off the main page that was a class activity and it needs work but I don't have the time.  There will be more usage of my site in future class activities, so I'm in quandary because if I need to turn in an assignment that doesn't look that great on this site...I still have to turn it in.  To fix this, I will plan list of small changes to make the site a little more pleasing to the eye, and maybe think of how to hide or minimize the impact of less than ready for prime time class activities. 

Jekyll Notes:
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
