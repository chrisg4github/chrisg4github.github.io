Still busy with class, so I'm not able to do much with this site.  However, some of my class activities are going to affect this site.  For example, now I have a Bio page off the main page that was a class activity and it needs work but I don't have the time.  There will be more usage of my site in future class activities, so I'm in quandary because if I need to turn in an assignment that doesn't look that great on this site...I still have to turn it in.  To fix this, I will plan list of small changes to make the site a little more pleasing to the eye, and maybe think of how to hide or minimize the impact of less than ready for prime time class activities.
