Tired of class...struggling with too much to do and learn.  I did push out some changes to my weather visualization today, so that made me happy.  Also, I'm going to make a some minor title changes to my home page, and a background color change to the home page and my Bio page.  I can't fix it all, but I can pick  one thing to improve and make my site just a little bit better than it was.  Thinking beyond terms of doing no harm, I need this site to be a showcase of what I've been doing and what I can do for some company even when I have to submit assignments that aren't perfect like my weather visualizations.  This page just like life, isn't just a checklist, each step in the journey is as important as the destination.
