Tired of class...struggling with too much to do and learn.  I did push out some changes for my weather visualization today, so that took some stress away.  Different subject...I'm going to make a some minor title changes and a background color change to my website's home page.  It isn't pretty, but I can't fix it all right now.  I can pick one thing to improve and make my site just a little bit better than it was.  Thinking beyond terms of "doing no harm", I need this site to be a place to show off my portfolio, what I've been doing in class, and what I can do for some company.  This website, just like life, isn't just a checklist, each step in the journey is as important as the destination.
